### 3. Headline (220 characters max)

**Formula:** Role | Specialty | Value Proposition

### 4. About Section (2,600 characters max)

I help SaaS companies find product-market fit and scale to $10M ARR.

My journey: Chemical engineer → consultant → PM → startup founder (failed) → PM leader. Each stop taught me something: analytical rigor, stakeholder management, user empathy, resilience.

What I do best:
• Turn ambiguous problems into clear product strategy
• Build data-informed features that users actually adopt
• Align cross-functional teams around shared goals

Proof points:
📈 Grew B2B analytics platform from 0 → 500 customers ($5M ARR)
🚀 Launched 3 products from 0→1, including Y Combinator-backed startup
📊 Built SQL-based analytics capability across 4 product teams
🎯 Led remote team of 8 engineers across 3 time zones

Currently: Senior PM at [Company], focused on [area].

Open to: Advisory roles, PM leadership opportunities, speaking engagements.
