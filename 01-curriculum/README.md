## How to Study Each Module

### Step 1: Read the Module (2-3 hours)

- Take notes in your own words
- Highlight unfamiliar terms
- Try to relate concepts to products you use

### Step 2: Review ReserveEasy Application (1-2 hours)

- See how theory applies in practice
- Study the actual artifacts created

### Step 3: Complete Exercises (3-5 hours)

- Apply concepts to your own product idea
- Use templates from the toolkit
- Document your work in GitHub

### Step 4: Self-Assessment (30 minutes)

- Can you explain concepts to someone else?
- Can you apply them without referring to notes?
- Do you understand the "why" not just the "what"?
