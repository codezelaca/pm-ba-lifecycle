---

## J

---

## M

**MAU (Monthly Active Users)** - Number of unique users who engage with a product in a month.

**Mermaid** - Text-based diagramming tool embedded in Markdown for creating flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.

**MoSCoW Prioritization** - Method categorizing features as: **M**ust-have, **S**hould-have, **C**ould-have, **W**on't-have (this time).

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** - Version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.

---

## N

**NFR (Non-Functional Requirement)** - Requirements specifying system quality attributes (performance, security, scalability) rather than specific behaviors.

**North Star Metric** - Single key metric that best captures the core value delivered to customers.

**NPS (Net Promoter Score)** - Customer loyalty metric measured by asking: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this product?"

---

## O

**OKR (Objectives and Key Results)** - Goal-setting framework where an Objective (qualitative goal) is measured by 3-5 Key Results (quantitative outcomes).

**OpenAPI (Swagger)** - Standard for describing REST APIs in a machine-readable format (YAML/JSON) enabling auto-generated docs and client libraries.

---

## P

**Persona** - Fictional character representing a user segment, including demographics, goals, frustrations, and behaviors.

**Planning Poker** - Estimation technique where team members independently select story point cards, then discuss discrepancies.

**Product Backlog** - Master list of all known work for a product, prioritized by the Product Owner.

**Product Owner (PO)** - Scrum role responsible for defining features, prioritizing backlog, and maximizing value.

---

## R

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** - Architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

**Retrospective (Retro)** - Meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on processes and identifies improvements.

**RICE Score** - Prioritization framework: **R**each × **I**mpact × **C**onfidence / **E**ffort.

**ROI (Return on Investment)** - Measure of profitability: (Gain - Cost) / Cost.

---

## S

**SaaS (Software as a Service)** - Software delivery model where applications are hosted in the cloud and accessed via the internet (subscription-based).

**Scrum** - Agile framework using fixed-length sprints (1-4 weeks) with defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team) and ceremonies.

**Scrum Master** - Facilitator ensuring the team follows Scrum practices and removes impediments.

**Spike** - Time-boxed research task to answer a technical question or reduce uncertainty before estimating a story.

**Sprint Review (Demo)** - Meeting at the end of a sprint where the team demonstrates completed work to stakeholders.

**Stakeholder** - Individual or group with an interest in the outcome of a project (e.g., customers, executives, engineers).

**Story Points** - Unit of measure for estimating the effort required to implement a user story, based on complexity, uncertainty, and effort.

---

## T

---

## U

**UAT (User Acceptance Testing)** - Final testing phase where actual users verify the system meets requirements before go-live.

**User Story** - Short description of a feature from the user's perspective: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]."
